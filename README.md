# Concrete-Compressive-Strength-Predictor

This Concrete Strength Prediction App is a machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit that predicts the compressive strength of concrete based on its ingredient proportions and age. Users can manually input values such as cement, slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse and fine aggregates, and curing age for batch predictions. The app uses a pre-trained regression model along with a scaler to ensure consistent input preprocessing. Designed with a visually appealing UI and background styling, the app is ideal for civil engineers, researchers, or students looking to quickly estimate concrete strength using data-driven predictions.
